Medusa Discovery

discovery.sh

Place a list of Openstack hosts in this directory, execute the script, and
discovery will parse out all the IP addresses and place them in the appropriate
locations.  Feel free to modify this file to use different inputs or even source
an environments file and run nova list commands from here if your environment
permits.
